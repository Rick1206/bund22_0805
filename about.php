                <p>The Bund 22 consists of six stories. The red-brick exterior came from the design inspiration of Davies & Thomas Civil Engineers. The building was originally built in 1906 for Swire Pacific, one of the many foreign banking institutions on the Bund, but became the site of a major pen factory. In 1986, three separate structures that were built over the years were combined and integrated into one. Those visiting the Bund 22 can bear witness to the three buildings' inner balconies facing one another, in a location that once served as a street alley in between the three buildings but is now the Bund 22's grand atrium. This masterpiece of architecture has now become the preferred venue for fashion shows featuring the most exquisite luxury and designer brands.</p>

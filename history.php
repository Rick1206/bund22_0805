                <h3>The Bund</h3>
                <p>Now a symbol for Shanghai's prosperity, the Bund has been historically viewed as the nucleus of Shanghai. The iconic, Colonial Era buildings, arranged in a row along the bank of the Huangpu River, have now become the forefront of international finance and trade.  </p>
                <p>After a century, the characteristics of the Old Bund has been retained on the  Bund, but at the same time the area has evolved to accommodate both the public service function of the financial industry as well as the sightseeing function of the tourism industry. According to the "Bund Area Urban Plan", collaboratively drafted by the Municipal Planning Bureau, the Municipal Huangpu River Office and Huangpu District Government in 2007, a "New Bund" has been proposed as an extension of the Bund's financial area and the World Expo Site in Puxi. This area will be developed to match the North Bund, making the South Bund a new and vibrant focal point.</p>

                <h3>Bund 22 — A new landmark for ultimate experience on the Bund</h3>
                <p>The Bund 22 Project is located right at the junction of the “old” and the “new” Bund, adjacent to Shiliupu Wharf.</p>
                <p>Originally, Bund 22 was a four-story eclectic building designed by Davies & Thomas Civil Engineers, funded and constructed by the Swire Pacific. It is the only international finance & business building that combined classic with modern styles in Shanghai. Due to functional requirements, the northern and southern wings of the building were extended to serve as warehouses in 1930. In 1949. after the founding of the P.R.C., Bund 22 was transformed into a state-owned ball pen factory. Soon afterwards, the three independent buildings merged into the current one. In 2009, the building was reconstructed into a five-story new landmark on the Bund with a total area of over 14,000 m2.</p>

                <p>With couture shops, boutiques, clubs and international gourmet restaurants, Bund 22 boasts its advantageous location: west of Huangpu River, north of the Bund transportation hub, south of ‘Bund Building Group’ and close to World Expo Site in Puxi, so that it will be full of development potential in the future. In the next ten years, it will also be the priority of government’s construction plan, which will create significant influence in the future.</p>
